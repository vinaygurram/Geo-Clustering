5. Store update (Same as above but for stores;;)
6. Update device ping
7. Update device state
8. Price updates


How to handle in the clusters ::
//Lets write in ruby we will make changes later
1. Inventory update (for a store)
   * Find all clusters containing the store (DONE)
   * do query for the store combinations
   * will also need to check for updates of category tree (create a new tree)
   * update the clusters & geo hash index
   * (Should we put the geo hash level product sub categories and categories ) (Probably not)
2.Inventory add
    * Find all clusters containing the store
    * do aggregation for the store combinations
    * update the clusters & geo hash index
    * (Should we put the geo hash level product sub categories and categories ) (Probably not)
3. Category Path Change

4. Catalog updates
    * Find all clusters containing the store
    * do aggregation for the store combinations
    * update the clusters & geo hash index
5. Update Listing Location
    * Rerun the cluster logic (Because addition of stores also happens)
5. Update Store Location
