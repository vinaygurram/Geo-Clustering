Geo Hash Clustering

What is geo hash?

  Geo hash —>It is a small location Box. The length and width of the box changes. A box can be from following ranges
         13.7cm *1.8cm to 150m*150m to 5004km*50004km
   Examples : g(5000*5000 box), gcpuuz9 (150*150 box), gcpuuz94kkp5 ()

How it works ::

Creation ::
Pick a geo hash (small area of 150m * 150m)
Pick up shops within 3kms(configurable)
Create a small cluster with 3-4 shops. Each cluster must have given % of the product coverage. (number of shops configurable)
Build clusters for each geo hash


Comparison with Existing model :

Shipper Distance ::
  Existing model :  Users selects 8 different products which are served by 8 different shops. Shipper have to travel lot of distance
  New Model : User only sees subset of products which are nearby

Cacheable Queries/API calls ::
  Geohash queries are cacheable as opposed to pin point queries

Pre computed :
  Existing Model : on the fly
  Clusters : Pre computed

Product Criteria (might remove manual addition)::
  Existing Model : Choose first two shops  automatically then if they not fulfill add additional shops
  New Model : The products are always present in the cluster so can be automated easily


Use cases ::


Existing APIS :

From the APP :
Catalog API —> Given lat and long ;; give super categories and categories
Category API —> Given super category or category give sub categories
Products API —> Given sub category and lat/long ;; give products
From the Fulfillment :
Get stores —> given lat/long and key/value pairs give store the fulfill the category
get shippers —> given lat/long give the shippers near to you

Updates From Catalog/Seller Engine

Impact on API and Reworking ::
  All new APIs must be backward compatible. So no need for new changes

From the APP —>
Catalog API —>change lat/long to GeoHash ;;from app side ;;; Give all super categories and categories for a geo hash //
Category API —> Choose a cluster based on criteria (criteria to be decided).and return all sub categories in the cluster
Products API —> add clusterId param to the call; list all the unique products in the cluster (cluster properties to be decided)
From the Fulfillment :
Get stores —> Please add cluster ID;; sorting and listing to be same;
Get Shippers —> no change as of now

Updates from the Catalog/Seller engine —>
Add Inventory —> need to rebuild the cluster for some hashes
Update Inventory —> check for rebuild then rebuild
Category Path —> check then rebuild
Update Store/Listing —> rebuild geo cluster
Update device ping —> no change
Catalog Update —> check and rebuild
