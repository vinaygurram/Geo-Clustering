DBSCAN :
Clustering distance can’t be controlled
Non core/Core point

K-means clustering ::
good but how to decide k points
if we chose each geo hash as centroid then how do you specify requirements
random clustering

Hierarchical Clustering ::
Using hierarchical clustering with centroid based clustering.
no factor to determine the total cluster distance
products have to be calculated on the go

GeoHash based Clustering ::
Clusters are formed for each geo hash
Clusters are not mutually exclusive

Requirements :
Step 1:
85% SC should be visible
SKU count should be more than 80% of total Bangalore products
Step 2: (Order by)
Current number of orders going on
shipper un availability
Core points and non core points
Step 3:
Order later
Seller rating

Bangalore Bounding Box ::

TopLeft :: (13.1245,77.3664)
BotRight :: (12.8342)

Geo hash precision : 7

Geo based Clustering ::

Requirements :
  Max number of shops == 4;
  Min number of products = 90%;
  Distance for the cluster should be minimum

Cluster properties :
Shop list
OrderCount (Total number of orders for each shop)
Seller Rating (Avg rating of all the shops)

Clustering Strategy :

Distance Calculation :: (Shortest Path)
 Lets say a cluster is formed with points 1…n;
  Total Distance  = Min(di+Si) for i=1..n
  di —> distance from ith point to Geohash Cell
  Si —> Shortest distance covering all the points in the cluster ending with ith point

Fav Factor ::
  F= (coverage) + distance
